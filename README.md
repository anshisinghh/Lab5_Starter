1. No, I would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application. Unit tests are typically used to test individual components of a system in isolation, such as functions or methods. It cannot be used for testing how individual components interact with each other on an application/feature level. Thus, testing the "message" feature would involve multiple components and interactions, such as user interface elements and network, which would not work for unit testing.
2. Yes, I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application. This feature can be easily isolated and tested within a single unit. Thus, a unit test can verify whether or not the constraints are applied correctly.
